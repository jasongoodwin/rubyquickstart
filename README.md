rubyquickstart
==============

A sing-along document showing you Ruby in 20 minutes. This is for experienced programmers who want a fast ramp up.
This is based heavily on the document found here: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/
No time will be wasted explaining concepts that you likely know if you're a fairly experienced programmer.
Setup is assumed complete of ruby and irb - they come pre-installed on OSX so many of you won't have to worry.

Warning
=======
I'm learning Ruby while writing this so it may not be complete or 100% correct. I'll revisit the document to make corrections about assumptions and update this section of the document with the corresponding confidence level I have in the correctness.

REPL/IRB
========
We'll be working through the basics through the REPL (read-eval-print-loop) as it's the best way to get quick feedback on experimentation while learning a language.
To start the REPL, open a terminal and type `irb`
You'll now be at the Ruby REPL aka the "Interactive Ruby Shell"
